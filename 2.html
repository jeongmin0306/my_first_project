  <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence,
    is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence
    displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as
    the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment
    and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
    Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines
    (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind,
    such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>
